My name is Bryan Wendt, I go by bw. I have been learning and working with computers ever since I was a kid. My fascination with how they worked, what they could do for a person, and being able to create on them has stuck with me since the first time I was able to use one.

I decided to start this Blog to mostly archive my thoughts and projects that I am working on. If it helps others, that is an added benefit.
